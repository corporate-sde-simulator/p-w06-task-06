# Meeting Notes - Sprint 28 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Nisha Gupta (Lead), Ravi, Intern

---

## Batch request coalescer

- **Nisha Gupta:** This is blocking our release. Ravi started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Ravi:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `requestCoalescer.js` and `batchExecutor.js`
- [ ] @Ravi - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Nisha Gupta - Final sign-off before merge
